** Brain tumor classification
*** Tumors of Neuroepithelial Tissue (WHO)
- Astrocytic Tumors
  - Pilocytic Astrocytoma (most common)
- Oligodendroglial tumors
  -
- Oligoastrocytic tumors
- Ependymal Tumors
- Choroid plexus tumors
- Other
- Neuronal and mixed neuronal-glial tumors
- Tumor of the pineal region
- Embryonal tumors
*** Cell type of origin classification

*** Low grade vs High Grade "Gliomas"
Gliomas are a broad group of tumors. In pediatrics, "gliomas"=="astrocytomas"
- Gliomas == Astrocytomas in pediatrics
  - Pylocytic ("low grade", WHO 1)
  - Fibrillary or infiltrative
    - diffuse fibrillary ("low grade", WHO 2)
    - Anaplastic ("High Grade", WHO 3)
    - GBM ("High Grade", WHO 4)
WHO categorization is a CLINICAL PROGNOSTIC classification system.  (There is no WHO 2 Pilocytic, for example).  Higher WHO is associated with worse prognosis, largely.

** Treatment overview
#+CAPTION: Overview of brain tumor Rx
#+NAME:   fig:braintumorRx
[[./braintumorRx.png]]
- Neurosurgery
  - Generally, needed, at least for biopsy
  - DIPG is a radiographic diagnosis
  - Most NG-GCT Dx is made based on CSF tumor markers
- Radiation
  - Potentially utilized for ALL CNS tumors
  - exceptions include low grade gliomas (initially) and choroid plexus papillomas
  - full dose = ~5400-5940 cGy
  - Craniospinal irradiation = ~1800-3600 cGy
- Chemo
  - Used as adjuvant therapy in most cases
  - Particularly useful for Germ cell tumors and Embryonal tumors
  - Used with little kids IN PLACE OF XRT, though this is inferior when used

** The tumors
*** TODO Medullo FILL IN GENETICS
    - Synonyms: Cerebellar PNET
    - Histo: SRBCT; different forms have different outcomes, so histology is useful.
    - Clinical presentation
      - Raised ICP (headache, vomiting)
      - Ataxia
      - Brainstem findings (sometimes)
    - Metastatic potential: Yes
      - Neuraxis (so must do spinal MRI either preop or more than 10 days postop, spinal CSF at least 10 days after resection due to risk of herniation)
      - Systemic spread very rare
    - Risk classification
|Features | Standard | High |
|---+---+---|
|Resection | <1.5 cm3 residual | >1.5 cm3 residual |
| M-staging | No mets | M+ |
| Histology |   | Anaplasia |
    - Genetics
      - Wnt group (children/adults) - Excellent prognosis
      - Sonic Hedgehog group (can include infants) - Fair 
      - Group 3 (i17q, MYC amp)
      - Group 4 (CDK4 amp, MYCN amp)
Molecular diagnostics have identified four major subgroups for medulloblastoma with differences in age of presentation, histopathologic features, and prognosis. The presence of nuclear beta-catenin staining, coupled with monosomy 6, supports the diagnosis of Wnt-positive medulloblastoma, which carries an excellent prognosis with almost all children successfully treated with standard-of-care therapy. Myc overexpression is most commonly seen in the group 3 subtype and carries a poor prognosis.
    - Imaging
      - brightly enhancing Midline mass, but lateralizes as you get older
      - A lateral mass in a younger kid is likely an ependymoma
    - Rx
      - Standard risk (>70% EFS)
        - Cut it out
        - CSI 2340 cGy with boost to 5400 cGy to tumor bed
        - Cisplatin/CCNC/VCR or Cisplatin/CTX/VCR
The standard of care for children with “standard risk” medulloblastoma (defined as a near total resection of the tumor with no evidence of neuraxis dissemination and no evidence of large-cell/anaplastic phenotype) currently is craniospinal irradiation (current standard 2,340 cGy) with a boost to the tumor bed to a total dose of approximately 5,400 cGy. In most centers, vincristine is given on a weekly basis during irradiation. Following irradiation, adjuvant chemotherapy is given, which is generally a combination of cisplatin/CCNU/vincristine or cisplatin/cyclophophamide/vincristine. This approach leads to long-term event-free survival (EFS) of > 80% in such patients.
      - High risk (20%-70% EFS, depending on risk factors)
        - Cut it out
        - Craniospinal radiation (3600 cGy)
  - Ependymoma (common location)
    - Clinical presentation
      - Can occur throughout CNS
      - Symptoms depend on location, often on floor of fourth ventrical
      - Raised ICP, especially for 4th ventrical tumors
    - Metastatic potential: Yes
      - Neuraxis
    - Staging: MRI brain/spine, CSF cytopathology, not clear whether anaplasia affects prognosis
    - Imaging:
#+CAPTION: Ependymoma imaging
#+NAME:   fig:ependymoma
[[./ependymoma.png]]
    - Rx
      - Aggressive upfront resection (GTR "required")
      - Non-met tumors (70% EFS):
        - Focal XRT ONLY, as CSI does not show benefit
        - Role of chemo uncertain
      - Met tumors (bad EFS):
        - Focal XRT and CSI (craniospinal)
        - Maybe chemo
  - Cerebellar astrocytome (usually pilocytic)
  - Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor (increasingly recognized)
*** Brain stem tumors
  - Almost any brain tumor histology CAN occur in the brain stem
  - Need to be able to distinguish between DIPG and low grade astrocytoma
  - DIPG
    - Technically is an anaplastic astrocytoma of fibrillary type in the brain stem
    - Synonyms: "Brain stem glioma" (though most gliomas of the brain stem are not DIPG
    - Met Potential: No
    - Staging:
      - MRI of the brain only (if classic on imaging)--tend NOT to enhance
      - biopsy for atypical imaging features
    - Lab features will reveal diffuse astrocytoma of WHO 2, 3, or 4 (though prognosis is the same--all die).
    - Imaging
      - diffuse pontine tumor encasing (but not obstructing) the basilar artery)
    - Rx
      - No curative therapy
      - XRT is routinely used for disease stabilization
      - No role for chemo
    - Progonosis: death within 6mos to 2 years in all cases
    - Pointers:
      - There is a difference between "intrinsic pontine glioms" and Exophytic brain stem glioma
      - Exophytic BSGs are usually pilocytic astrocytomas with much better prognosis
      - PAs in the brain stem brightly enhance on post-gad MRI and are often in other of brain stem areas besides pons
      - DIPG tends not to enhance, while PAs tend to enhance post-gad
*** Pilocytic astrocytomas
  - Can occur anywhere in CNS, but common locations are:
    - Cerebellum (cerebellar astrocytoma)
    - Optic pathway (optic pathway glioma)
    - hypothalamus
    - brain stem
    - spinal cord
  - very slow growing
  - synonyms: astrocytoma (WHO 1), "low grade" glioma (not precise, though)
  - clinical presentation: location dependent
  - Met: Not really
  - staging: MRI, brain, spine
  - Laboratory features: BRAF mutations (V600E) and relevance for therapy, if present
  - Imaging:
#+CAPTION: Pilocytic astrocytoma with enhancing nodule and cystic mass
#+NAME:   fig:pilo
[[./pilo.png]]
  - Rx:
    - Dependent on location
    - GTR is curative (cerebellar) and no further Rx needed
    - If GTR is not possible (optic pathway, hypothalamic [midline] tumors):
      - observation in few cases
      - Best effort resection then chemo/rad
  - Pointers:
    - Can occur anywhere
    - GTR is usually curative
    - Optic pathway tumors associate with NF-1 and often should be left alone
*** AA and GBM 
  - synonyms: Astrocytoma (WHO 3 and 4), high-grade gliomas
  - Clinical: variable, headaches, seizures due to ST predilection
  - Met: No (mainly no)
  - Staging: MRI brain/spine
  - Lab features: MGMT promoter methylation increasingly assayed (may be useful to know about for TMZ use)
  - Rx:
    - Best effort resection
    - Focal XRT, but hard to define because these tend to be very diffuse
    - Alkylators: TMZ or BCNU or CCNU
  - ~15-30% EFS
  - Pointers
    - No chemo except alkylating agents (nitrosureas and TMZ) are helpful
    - Anaplastic Astrocytoma is a spectrum disease, so some lower grade (WHO2) may do OK. Need to ask pathologist for "how much" AA is the patient.
*** Germinoma
  - synonyms: non-secreting GCT
  - clinical:
    - suprasellar: DI, panhypopituitarism
    - pineal: parinauds (can't look up, raised ICP)
  - met: Yes
  - staging
    - ~biopsy needed for diagnosis~
    - MRI brain, spine, CSF pathology
    - 10% of of germinomas can be pineal and suprasellar (multifocal)
  - lab: CSF markers (AFP/beta-HCG) should be negative.
  - Rx 
    - At least whole ventricular XRT
    - +/- chemo
    - If presented with DI or panhypopit, will not recover that function
*** NG-GCT
  - synonyms: secreting GCT
  - clinical: all maybes: Precocious puberty , DI, panhypopit, raised ICP
  - Met: can
  - staging:
    - MRI brain/spine
    - no biopsy if markers (AFP/beta-HCG elevated)
  - Rx
    - harder to treat than germinoma
    - XRT includes CSI
    - Second look surgery may be needed if markers still up
  - 40-70% 
*** Spinal cord tumors
  
** Factoids
*** Diencephalic syndrome
These findings represent the classic symptoms of the diencephalic syndrome. The syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by a tumor, frequently quite large, centered in the diencephalon. Symptoms include failure to thrive with an emaciated appearance. Length is usually preserved. Children often are described as happy and outgoing despite their emaciated appearance. Additional symptoms can include vomiting, visual abnormalities, headache, and pallor.
** Genetic associations
*** Tuberosis Sclerosis
Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) occurs in up to 20% of individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and is more likely to develop during childhood and adolescence. SEGA is a type of brain tumor that occurs in individuals with TSC that is noncancerous and is not malignant but can still be very problematic. mTOR inhibitors effective.
*** NF1 screening
Just optho, not MRI unless issues.
*** AT/RT
    INI1/hSNF5/SMARCB1 gene. More sarcoma-like than other brain tumors. Be sure to test for germline mutation.
*** Rb
  - SRBCT in the pineal region
  - Possibility of trilateral disease, pineoblastoma
* Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia
- Steve Humger, CHOP
** Incidence and Epidemiology
*** Epidemiology
- Peaks at 2-4 years (80 new cases/million drops to 20 new cases by 10 years)
- Incidence in whites 2x blacks
*** Genetic risk factors
- Low hypodiploid (30-39 chromosomes) is a Li Fraumeni Syndrome disease with ~50% having TP53 germline mutations.
- Rare PAX5 germline mutations
- 4-5% of ped leukemias have germline mutations in known cancer predisposing genes.
** Pointers
*** Surface markers
- Almost all cases of Pre-B ALL are CD19+, CD22+, CD79a+
- CD10- is most associated with MLL-rearrangement
- Pre-B ALLs lack surface Immunoglobulin, so if there are Surface Ig positive, it is Burkitt's (or mature B-cell ALL)
- Burkitt's are <2% of ALL
  - Unique L3 morphology and express surface Ig
  - High frequency of CNS involvement
  - Tumor lysis high risk, LDH often high
  - Need to be treated as Burkitt's, not typical ALL therapy
  - May be associated with immunodef states
  - c-Myc to heavy or light chain
    - t(2;8), t(8;14), t(8;22)
- T-ALL
  - (cytoplasmic)CD3+, TdT+
  - higher incidence in males, older teens, and blacks
  - Associated with high incidence of tumor lysis, high white count, mediastinal mass
- Relationship between surface expression and ALL subsets
| type | CD19 | CD10 | ctyoIg | surfaceIg |
|---+---+---+---+---|
| Pro-B | + | - | - | - |
| Pre-pre-B (common) | + | + | - | - |
| Pre-B | + | - | + | - |
| Mature B (Burkitt's) | + | +/- | +/- | + ( MONOCLONAL kappa or lambda) |
  - CD10 is positive early and lost later
  - Lack of CD10 is linked to MLL.  About half of ALLs that are MLL-R are CD10- and half of CD10- are MLL-R
*** Oddities
- Recognize hypereosinophilia as a rare presenting feature of ALL
  - eosinophils are reactive and NOT part of the malignant clone
  - eosinophil count of 10k-100k
- ALL can mimic JRA. Low WBC, low-normal plts, and nighttime pain predictive of ALL over JRA
- How ALL differs from ITP
  - Most patients with ITP are otherwise healthy
  - With ITP, parents can often tell exact onset of bruising
*** Extramedullary disease
- CNS involvement
  - Definition
    - CNS1: no blasts, regartless on number of WBCs on cytospin
    - CNS2: WBCs <5/\microL, cytospin blast+, negative to steinherz/bleyer (2x greater WBC/RBC compared to peripheral blood, accounts for traumatic tap)
    - CNS3: >= 5/\microL WBCs and blast+ or clinical signs of CNS involvement
    - 5 cells is CNS3
  - Common in infants and Burkitt's (15-25%)
  - Intermediate in T-ALL
  - low in non-infant B-ALL (2%)
- Testicular involvement
  - Present at Dx in <1-2% of boys
  - Associated with other high-rish features: T-ALL, high WBC
  - Biopsy for diagnosis
- Prognostic importance of time to relapse
  - Extramedullary (CNS or testicular)
    - Early is defined as <18 months from Diagnosis and is much worse outcome than later
*** Gene rearrangments
| cyto | molec | incidence | outcome | comments |
|---+---+---+---+---|
| t(21;21) | ETV6-RUNX1 | 20-25%, so most common | Excellent | Less common > 15yrs |
| t(1;19) | TCF3-PBX1 | 5% (25% of pre-B ALL) | Neutral | higher incidence of CNS disease and relapse |
| t(v;11) or t(11;v) | MLL-rearrangement, more than 50 partners | 3% | poor | 75% of infants<1 year have MLL-$ |
| t(9;22) | BCR-ABL1 | ~4% | Poor with chemo alone | treat with TKI |
| t(8;14), t(2;8), t(8;22) | c-Myc fusion to IgH, IgL, or IgK | Rare | treat like Burkitt NHL | Burkitt Leukemia |
*** Prognostic factors
- Clinical and lab
  - NCI Risk Groups defined by:
    - Age
    - WBC
    - Immunophenotype
    - Standard risk (65%)
      - age 1-9.99 years
      - WBC < 50k
      - EFS ~90%
    - High risk (35%)
      - age <1 or >10 OR WBC>50k
      - EFS 75-80% (with more intensive therapy)
      - infants still poor, treated with infant protocols
  - Presence/absence of extramed disease dictates need for specific therapies
  - ALL genotype strongly influences prognosis, stratification, and sometimes use of targeted therapies (TKI for Ph+ ALL)
- ~Response to therapy is the strongest prognostic factor~
  - Good risk, <1000 blasts/microL in PB at day 7
  - Day 8 and day 15 bone marrows (not used anymore)
    - M1 < 5% blasts, M2 5-25%, M3 >25%
    - outcome M1 > M2 > M3
- Minimal residual disease
  - MRD at day 30 is most prognostic factor, better than day 8/15 marrows, so use that instead.
  - technologies:
    - Flow phenotypes
    - PCR of antigen receptor loci (Ig or TCR)
    - PCR of translocation-derived fusions only for defined subgroups (Ph+ ALL, for example)
- Chromosome number
| cyto                                            | incidence | outcome   | comment                          |
|-------------------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+----------------------------------|
| hyperdiploid DNA index >1.16 or 53+ chromosomes |    20-25% | excellent | trisomy 4, 10, adb 17 best       |
| Hypodiploid <44 chromosomes or DNA index <0.81  |      1-2% | poor      | worsening with fewer chromosomes |
- Ph+
  - 3-4% of ALL are ph+, but increases with age
  - imatinib changes outcome very significantly, so give continuously during chemo
- T-ALL genetics/genomics
  - hyper- and hypo-diploid are uncommon
  - fusions uncommon
  - TCR translocations on 14q11 and 7q35
** Treatment
*** Overall
- Induction
  - Steroids (Dex, Pred)
  - VCR
  - Asparaginase
  - +/- anthracycline (Daunorubicin, typically)
- Delayed intensification
  - Benefit established for SR and HR, two no better than one
- Therapy for SR vs high risk
| SR                                            | HR                                                 |

| Maint with q4wk steroid/VCR pulses            | Maint with q4wk steroid/VCR pulses                 |
*** CNS disease
- Intrathecal MTX
- radiation not used much except for CNS3 disease
- 1800 cGy to brain and posterior of eyes
- Effective systemic therapy is critical for CNS relapse
- Adverse effects of CNS therapy
  - Intrathecal
    - Arachnoiditis
    - Seizures (1-2%)
    - Transient stroke-like episodes 7-10 days post IT
  - MRI is abnormal in 1/2 of patients, calcification is worrisome.
  - Irradiation somnolence syndrome 5-7 weeks post Rx
  - MTX and cXRT toxicity--give IV MTX first and THEN cXRT
  - Development of secondary brain tumors (10X years post XRT). Meningioma highly curable, others not.
*** Dealing with specific phases of therapy
- Eval ALL patient with seizures
  - Diff Dx includes leukemia, infx, metab, CVA, drug toxicity (especially MTX)
  - CVA secondary to ASNase in induction (uncommon)

    - lab: increased Uric Acid, PO4, and K+
    - clinical: increased Creatinine, seizures, cardiac dysrhythmias
  - Highest risk in Burkitt's, infant ALL, high WBC, bulky extramedullary disease
  - Prophylaxis
    - 2x maint fluids
    - alk of urine (reduce change of urate crystals)
    - allopurinol
  - Rasburicase (urate oxidase) in very high risk
  - Do NOT alk if TLS present.  Use Rasburicase instead.
- Relapse
  - prognostic:
    - BM worse than Extramed
    - earlier worse
    - age at Dx (teenagers bad)
    - Immunophenotype
      - T-ALL very poor relapse
      - Relapsed TEL-AML1 (ETV6-RUNX1) does relatively well
    - For BM relapse, high risk is 36mos
    - for extramed replapse, high risk before 18 mos
  - Testicular
    - 1-2% of boys
    - Rx with Bilat XRT (2400 cGy), intensive systemic Rx
  - Role of Allo SCT
    - SCT for ALL with early first marrow relapse (<36 mos)
    - matched sib and unrelated equivalent
    - SCT for ALL 2nd relapse
    - SCT for any T-ALL BM relapse
*** Late effects
- Cardiac toxicity from anthracyclines, but not much of an issue for ALL since not high doses
- Osteonecrosis or Avascular Necrosis
  - low risk in pts < 10yrs with less intensive Rx
  - Higher risk in females and in >10yo
  - hip, knee, ankle most common
  - all develop within 2 years of Dx, basically.
* Myeloid Neoplasms

- M0-M2 just myeloid with different degrees of differentiation
- M3 APL
- M4-M5 Monocytic
*** WHO (20% blasts)
- based on clinical and molecular
- Just based on four questions
  - Is AML due to prior therapy?
    - therapy-related AML (t-AML)
  - Is Downs-related?
    - DS-related AML
  - Is major ("Big 4") molecular abnormality? (if so, no minimum %blasts needed)
    - t(8;21) = M2
    - inv(16) = M4Eo
    - t(15;17) = APL, M3
    - MLL-r
  - Is there prior MDS or (del(7), del(5q), etc.)
    - AML with MDS
  - If no to all, use FAB classification
*** The Big 4
- KNOW THIS TABLE
| cyto     | molecular                | FAB    | Characteristics                                |
|----------+--------------------------+--------+------------------------------------------------|
| t(8;21)  | AML1-ETO (RUNX1-RUNX1T1) | M2     | Auer Rods, Chloromas, Good Px                  |
| t(15;17) | PML-RARA                 | M3     | Granules, Auer rods, Good Px with ATRA/Arsenic |

| 11q23    | MLL                      | M4, M5 | infant, hyperleuko, skin, CNS, gums, t-AML     |
*** APL
- High risk of bleeding (~10% mortality)
- close monitoring of coags
- Start ATRA ASAP
- Differentiation syndrome as promyelocytes differentiate
  - start on steroids, hold ATRA until resolved
- Low risk APL (<10k WBC) ATRA and arsenic ONLY.
*** MDS vs AML
- Uncommon for AML to have MDS precursor
- When MDS occurs in kids, progression to AML is general rule
- Allo SCT is generally needed for MDS
*** Characteristic clinical presentations of AML and their subtypes
- DIC/bleeding (APL)
- Hyperleukocytosis - M4/M5 (MLL-related 
  - elevated WBC > 100k (AML cutoff is lower than ALL)
  - sludging in brain, lungs, kidneys
  - CNS-lethargy, bleeding
  - Hypoxia, resp distress, diffuse infiltrates
  - Renal insufficiency
  - Management: 
    - treat leukemia ASAP
    - leukopheresis short term fix only
- CNS Leukemia (M4, M5 monocytic)
- Leukemia cutis - M4/M4 (monocytic)
- Chloromas - M2, monocytic
*** Immunophenotyping
- Pan-myeloid: CD13, 33, 65
- Monocytic: 11b, 14, 15
- Megakaryocytic: 41, 42, 61
- APL: bright 33, 15+, HLA-DR-, 34-
- t(8;21): often CD19+
*** ALL of ambiguous lineage
- often MLL-rearranged
- Acute undiff leuk--no lineage-specific markers
- Mixed Phenotype Acute Leukemia (MPAL)
  - mixed T/AML or B/AML
** Prognostic factors
*** Not used for Rx decisions
- Age and sex
- race: non-whites do worse
- BMI: under or over worse Px
- High WBC not used except in APL (>10k is high risk, so use anthracycline)
- FAB: supplanted by cyto/molecular
*** Recent risk stratification
- Favorable
  - DS-related
  - APL
  - inv(16), t(8;21)
  - MRD measurement
    - <0.1% cutoff at end of course 1
- Unfavorable
  - therapy-related-AML
  - cyto: -7, 5q-, abn(3q)
  - FLT3/ITD
  - primary induction failure (>5% blasts after course 2)
  - MRD measurement
    - >0.1% cutoff at end of course 1
** Therapy
- Remission induction
  - 2 courses of Ara-C, Doxo or Dauno, etoposide
  - current protocol switches 2nd for mitoxantrone/HD ara-c for HR patients
- Post-remission consolitation
  - BMT
    - All HR with best donor
    - No LR patients
  - Additional chemo intensification courses (2)
    - HR w/o donor, all LR
    - Usually HD Ara-C combined with something not used in induction (mitoxantrone, L-asp)
- CNS
  - Much less intense than ALL
  - No cXRT in AML
  - weekly ara-C IT until clear CSF
- No role for maintenance therapy in AML
- Supportive
  - Strep viridans and gram negative 
  - G-CSF not use in AML
- Late effects
  - Anthrocyclines: ~450 mg/m2
  - High-dose Ara-C: neurotoxicity
  - Etoposide: t-MDS/AML
- Radiation: only for emergent treatment of complications (chloromas, spinal cord compression, etc.)
** CML
- Ph+
- Priapism is not common, but occurs
- Three phases
  - Chronic
  - Accelerated
  - Blast crisis - 2/3 are AML, 1/3 ALL
    - BCR-ABL fusion in two forms used to dist. ALL from CML in blast crisis
      - p210 = CML
      - p190 = ALL
- Treatment is generally TKI. After accelerated phase or blast crisis, get back to chronic and then to HSCT
- On TKI, should see slow response over 12 months.


* Educational methodology
Jennifer C. Kesselheim, Boston Children's
** Androgogy
- Malcolm Knowles - 1980 book on Androgogy (adult learning vs. pedagogy, child)
- Adult learners are autonomous and goal-directed
- Adult learners need to assume responsibility for their own learning
  - presentations
  - answering questions with "go read that"
- Adult learners look for teachers as facilitators
  - respect for learners
  - solicit learners' perspectives
- Questions for students
  - what are you hoping to learn?
  - where will your future career go?
  - How can today's learning serve you in that future?
- Individualized Learning Plan (ILP)
  - update regularly
- David Kolb - cycle of experiential learning
  - steps 
    - Concrete experience - Doing
    - Reflection - Think about the experience
    - Abstract conceptualization - link your message with their experience
    - Experimentation - Improve performance based on better understanding
  - OPTIOMAL learning requires all four steps
    - if people get rushed, they oscillate between concrete experience <--> experimentation
** Hidden curriculum
  - Teaching that contradicts formal curriculum
  - exists in everyday experience of learners
    - Behavior in role models
    - implied by behaviors of peers
** Feedback and evaluation
*** Feedback
- Types of feedback
  - Formative 
    - Informal
    - intermediate timing
    - Provides opportunity for improvement
  - Summative
    - May be more formal
    - reflects formative feedback (no surprises!)
- Expectations
- Giving feedback (Ramani and Kackov, 2012; just for my info)
  - prepare yourself and the receiver
  - choose time and place
  - Identify it as feedback
  - Allow learner to self-assess
  - First give positive feedback
  - Identify areas for improvement
  - CREATE plan for improvement
  - leave time for discussion!
  - solicit feedback on your own performance
*** Assessment
- Feedback is NOT the same as assessment
- Formal
- Need assessment tools
- Collect objectively
- hierarchy of behaviors
  - from novice to master
** Educational planning
- Determine desired outcome (big picture)
- Needs assessment; determing gap between the idea and the actual
  - collect data from learners, teachers, professionals
- Learning objectives
  - Use "action verbs" (identify, classify, select, ...)
- Teaching methods
  - one size doesn't fit all
- Evaluation of Outcomes
  - Plan should be made at the *start* of the process
  - Often a missed step
  - How
    - Satisfaction?
    - Feasibility (can you do it)
    - Did the teaching meet the objectives (whatever they were)

* Hemoglobinopathies
Charles Quinn, Cincinnatti Children's
- Hemoglobin
  - Heme + Globin
  - Disorders of heme ==> sideroblastic anemias, etc.
  - Globin
    - Two alpha globins + Two beta globins

| Hb Barts | Abnormal Hb    | \gamma_4          |
| Hb H     | Abnormal Hb    | \beta_4           |
- Disorders of Hemoglobin
  - Quantitative
    - Thalassemias
    - Decreased (imbalance) production of normal globin genes
  - Qualitative
    - Structural variants or hemoglobinopathies
    - production of abnormal globin chains
** Thalassemias
#+CAPTION: normal hemoglobin production
#+NAME:   fig:normalheme
[[./normalheme.png]]

- \alpha-Thalassemia
  - Since \alpha chain shared in fetal and adult, both fetuses and adults affected
  - excess of \beta chains
#+CAPTION: alpha thalassemia
#+NAME:   fig:alphathal
[[./alphathal.png]]

- \beta-thalassemia

#+CAPTION: beta thalassemia
#+NAME:   fig:betathal
[[./betathal.png]]
  - Relative deficiency of adult \beta-globin. Fetal and neonates fine.
  - Excess of \alpha chains
- Pathophysiology
  - imbalance of \alpha and \beta globins
  - excess of globins causes ineffective erythropoiesis and damages RBCs
- Nomenclature
  - Genetic Defect
    - \alphaa-thalassemia: defect in \alpha globins
    - \beta-thalassemia: defect in \beta globins
    - \delta\beta-thalassemia: defect in both \delta and \beta globins
    - etc...
  - Clinical Severity
    - Minor: mild anemia, asymptomatic trait state
    - Intermedia: moderate anemia, intermittent transfusion
    - Major: severe anemia, transfusion-dependent
- Typical mutations
  - \alpha
    - deletions
  - \beta
    - point mutations in regulatory leading to changes in production
    - \beta+ decreased
    - \beta0 absent
- Overview of Alpha thal
  - number of genes
    - 4 genes = normal
    - 3 genes = silent carrier
    - 2 genes = thal trait (minor)
      - Hb Barts (\gamma_4) in neonates (5-10%), but disappears
      - hypochromic, microcytic
    - 1 gene  = HbH disease (intermedia)
      - Hb Barts (\gamma_4) in neonates (25-50%), but disappears
      - Hb H (\beta_4) at 5-10% in adults
      - Hb Constant Spring is very unstable, so looks like a missing copy of gene
    - 0 genes = hydrops fetalis (\alpha-thal major)
  - Asian genotype typically in cis, so higher risk of hydrops fetalis
  - African genotype typically in trans, so lower risk of hydrops fetalis
#+CAPTION: Risk of Thalassemia Major in Offspring Depends on Trait Genotype
#+NAME: fig:hydropsrisk
[[./hydropsrisk.png]]

- \Beta thal
  - Caused by point mutation that leads to decreased or absent production
  - number of productive genes
    - 2 genes = normal
    - 1 normal, 1 decreases = \beta-thal trait (minor)
      - Neonates normal, since they are using \gamma, not \beta
      - Progressively hypochromia and microcytosis
      - Elevated HbA_2 and sometimes HbF
    - 1 reduced, 1 absent = \beta-thal intermedia
      - Neonates normal
      - adults HbA_2 and HbF increased
    - both absent expression = \beta-thal major (Cooley's Anemia)
      - Neonates: only HbF present
      - progressively HbF and A2 only
        - severe anemia
        - organomegaly and growth failure
  - HbE behaves like B+
- Rx
  - consider SCT for transfusion-dependent
  - transfuse to keep Hb>10 to reduce ineffective erythropoiesis (reducing extramedullary erythro)
  - Chelation for iron overload
    - Quantify iron by MRI in liver and heart
  - splenectomy for marked hypersplenism
** Sickle Cell Disease
- Variant = \beta^{6 glu->val}
- Sickling is due to polymerization of \beta chains after deoxygenation
- SS > SC disease in prevalence
- Management
  - Proph penicillin
  - Hyposplenism begins ~ 3mos
  - Splenic sequestration --> splenomegaly, Retics, NRBCs present
  - Transient aplastic crisis --> no splenogaly, no retics, NRBCs absent
  - Fever
    - sick = hospitalize
    - well-looking = outpatient with close followup
  - Pain
    - pain management
    - Acute chest syndrome - treat empirically for infx (cef/azithromycin)
  - CNS
    - Stroke 
      - TCD screening yearly between 2-16 years
    - Overt stroke
      - transfusion immediately
  - Complications
    - Retinopathy
    - AVN
    - Cardiomyopathy
    - Pulm Hypertension
    - Chronic lung disease
    - Renal
  - Transfusion (for stroke, recurrent problems)
    - Hb < 10 max
* Immunology and Immunodeficiency
Sung-Yun Pai, Boston Children's
** Overview 
#+CAPTION: White blood cells overview
#+NAME: fig:whitecells
[[./whitecells.png]]

** Infections in the immunocompromised host
*** HSCT
#+CAPTION: Common HSCT infections and timing
#+NAME: fig:whitecells
[[./posthsct.png]]
*** infections
- F&N
- Spleen
  - Opsonization of encapsulated organisms
  - functional or full splenectomy
    - prophylaxis with penicillin for a couple of years
    - after that, need to be treated for fever
- Fungal
  - prophylaxis for prolonged F&N
  - for high risk groups
- Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly PCP)
  - risk from HSCT, HIV, steroids, chemo, SCID
  - sulfa-trim (bactrim)
- Viral
  - CMV ganciclovir, foscarnet; leukoreduce or CMV- blood products for CMV- patients
  - VZV acyclovir
** Immune system review
- T-cells
  - CD4 = MHC class II
  - CD8 = MHC class I
  - Maturation in thymus
    - TCR rearrangement
- B-cells
  - produce antibodies
  - Need CD4-T-cell cooperation
  - Antibodies for opsonization
  - Maturation is in BM
    - BCR (Ig) rearrangement
*** Workup
- Measuring cell subsets
  - CD3 - T 
    - CD4 = helper
    - CD8 = cytolytic
  - CD19 - B cell
  - CD16 or CD56 = NK cells
- Measure function
  - Non-specific
    - T-cell
      - Measure proliferation to *mitogens*, does not measure interaction with TCR, so non-specific
        - Phytohemagglutin (PHA)
        - PWM
    - B-cell 
      - measure total IgG, IgA, IgM
      - remember that antibody production also requires intact T-cells
  - specific
    - T-cell
      - proliferation to antigen such as tetanus, candida
    - B-cell
      - Protein Ag such as tetanus
      - Carbohydrate antigen such as pneumovax, blood group, Isohemmoglutinins
- IgG crosses placenta; IgM, IgA do not

- *TAKE HOME POINTS*
  - infants and children have higher ALC and T-cell numbers than adults
  - IgG crosses the placenta, so highest at birth, drops until 2-6 months, then start making their own, so comes back
** Congenital immunodeficiency states
#+CAPTION: Major differences in ped HL vs NHL

|-------------+---------------------+--------------------|
| T-Cells     | SCID                | Ex: WAS            |
| B-Cells     | X-linked Agammaglob | Ex: Common Variable Immunodef |
| Neutrophils | SCN                 | Ex: CGD            |
*** SCID (failure of T-cell development [at least])
- genetically heterogeneous group of syndromes having in common a profound disturbance in the development and function of both T and B cells
- XL or AR inherit
- Absence of functional autologous T-cells is a uniform problem
- B-cells may be present or absent, but they do not work since no specific antibody production
- Generally 
- Failure to thrive, thrush, DiGeorge
- Dx
  - Check ALC, lymphocyte subsets
    - lack of all lymphocytes should be ADA SCID
  - Lymphocyte proliferation (function) studies - will be abnormal (absent) with SCID
  - total IgG, IgA, IgM
- Rx
  - ALL BLOOD PRODUCTS MUST BE IRRADIATED to avoid TA-GVHD
  - PCP prophylaxis
  - IgG replacement
- Note that HSCT can be done *without* conditioning or any GVHD prophylaxis
*** XLA (X-linked agammaglobulinemia) Failure of B-cell development
- Due to mutation in BTK (Bruton's tyrosine kinase)
- There is a waning of maternal IgG at 2-6 months, so patients present at 6-9 months
*** Wiskott-Aldrich
- X-linked disorder (WAS or WASP gene)
- Triad
  - immunodeficiency
  - eczema
  - thrombocytopenia with small platelets
- risk of bleeding, infection, autoimmunity, or lymphoma
- Combined T&B defect
  - T & B function will be affected
- Curable by early well-matched HSCT
*** Hyper-IgM
- defects in IgM class switching
- XLR leads to both B and T 
- HSCT may be used
*** X-linked lymphoproliferative (XLP)
- XLR with SAP gene defect
- Clinical 
  - fulminant often fatal acute EBV
  - lymphoproliferation usually non-clonal
  - recurrent infections due to dys and hypo gammaglobulinemia
*** CVID
- a genetic immune defect characterized by significantly decreased levels of IgG, IgA and/or IgM with poor or absent antibody production, with exclusion of genetic or other causes of hypogammaglobulinemia
- genetic defect unknown....
- autoimmune disease (ITP, Evans, AIHA) common
*** *TAKE HOME MESSAGE FOR non-SCID Immunodeficiencies*
- Boys with XLA lack B cells but have normal T cell function
- WAS is a triad of small low platelets, eczema, combined T and B cell dysfunction
-  Boys with WAS are at risk for bleeding, infection, lymphoma, autoimmunity (i.e. these things can be elicited on family history)
- A boy that is super sick with EBV--think XLP
- Patients with antibody deficiencies (i.e. CVID) and ALPS frequently have autoimmune cytopenias

- Classic HL
  - Reed sternberg (owl's eyes)
  - CD15+, CD30+
  - B-cell markers down, typically
  - Four types (NOT USED FOR RISK STRATIFICATION)
| subtype                                | description     |  EBV |
|----------------------------------------+-----------------+------|
| Nodular sclerosing (most common)       | Young adults    |  25% |

| lymphocyte predom (third most common)  | <10y            |  42% |
| Lymphocyte depleted                    | adults with HIV | 100% |
- Nodular Lymph Predominant HL
  - LP cell (popcorn)
  - CD45+
  - B-cell markers present
  - YMCA 
    - Young (18% of <10yearold), Male (80% of NLPHL are male), Contained, Asymptomatic (no "B" symptoms)
- Interesting: Neoplastic cells are <10% of the tumor with cytokins expressed causing the histologic changes
- Presentation
  - painless lymphadenopathy
  - mediast mass (~2/3)
  - Constitutional
    - B symptoms (prognostic)
      - weight loss (10% in 6 mos)
      - night sweats
      - unexplained fever
    - Other not (fatigue, anorexia, mild wt loss)
  - CRP, ESR up
  - may have immune dysregulation (ITP, AIHA, autoimmune neutropenia)
- workup
  - usual, but also EXCISIONAL or INCISIONAL LN biopsy (not needle)
  - Bilateral BM biopsy with B-symptoms or Stage III/IV
  - CT, CXT, FDG-PET, MRI Abd/Pelvis
- Staging using Ann Arbor staging classification
  - Useful for risk stratification because Hodgkin lymphoma spreads predictably along contiguous lymph nodes until it is very advanced
  - Stage I: single node region (I) or single extranodal organ or site (IE).
  - Stage II: two or more node regions on the same side of the diaphragm (II) or one node region and localized extranodal site on the same side of the diaphragm (IIE).
  - Stage III: node regions are involved on both sides of the diaphragm (III) and may include a localized extranodal site (IIIE) the spleen (IIIS) or both (IIISE).
  - Stage IV: Diffuse / disseminated involvement of more >1 extranodal site. 
  - Stages are sub-classified into “A” or “B” based on the absence or presence of systemic systems. Bulk disease is also risk stratification.
- Rx
  - Multimodal
    - multiagent chemo AND RT are standard
    - survial >90%, even for advanced disease
  - Given good outcomes, goal is to reduce therapy where possible

  - Major concepts
    - Ocularpreservation vs. enucleation
      - Avoid or delay RT
    - Risk-adapted therapies
      - Intraocular vs. orbital vs. extraorbital
    - Two different scenarios: UL and BL
  - Avoid or delay RT for ocular salvage
    - Important impact on orbital growth
    - Risk of second malignancies(heritableRB)
  - Unilateral
    - Intraocular
      - can we do ocular salvage (cryotherapy, intra-arterial chemo, local RT)?
      - Chemoreduction
        - VCR + Carbo +/- Etop
      - Then local therapy
    - Enucleation
      - Unilateral > Bilateral (for obvious reasons)
      - If done, if there is evidence of extra-retinal disease, observe

- IHC staining in RMS
  - ERMS is a spindle cell tumor, so differentiate from Synovial
  - ARMS is a SRBCT, so differentiate from Lymphoma, NB, EWS/PNET
| tumor      | markers                              |

      - CNS extension in 50%
  - GU
    - favorable locations = paratesticular, vagina, uterus
    - unfavorable locations = bladder/prostate

  - Surgery
    - Primary therapy before other therapy
    - Try HARD to get it out without major 
  - Radiation (presurgical volume)
  - chemo
    - Standard over 45 weeks (60% FFS)
      - VCR
      - Actino
      - Cyclophosphamide
    - very low risk (85% FFS)
      - VA or VA with lower cy dose

      - interval compression (every two weeks)
- Monitor treatment
  - PE, every 1-3 months
  - Imaging every 3 months
- Interestingly, response at wk 12 does NOT predict overall outcome
- Recurrence is bad


*** Non-rhabdoid soft tissue sarcomas
- 40% of soft sarcomas < 5yrs, 77% of soft tissue sarcs 15-19 
– Treatment: Surgery, RT for residual, +/- Chemotherapy
  - Group I; observe unless grade 3 and > 5 cm, then consider RT and/or
chemotherapy (Dox + Ifos)
  - Group II; RT alone unless grade 3 and/or > 5 cm, then consider chemotherapy
(Dox + Ifos)
  - Group III-IV or grade 3 and > 5 cm any group; chemotherapy (Dox + Ifos), RT,
delayed surgery
  - Role of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (pazopanib) under investigation
- PROBABLY NO QUESTIONS on TREATMENT of NRSTS
- Prognosis

** Osteosarcoma
- Predisposing factors
  - ionizing radiation
  - Hereditary Rb
- Genetics
  - Supernumerary ring chromosome (12q13-15) characteristic of parosteal OS
  - Rb
  - TP53
  - RECQL4
    - Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome (short stature, cataracts, bony abnormalities)

    – Telangiectatic OS
    – Small round cell OS 
    – Low grade central OS
  - Surface tumors
    – Parosteal OS (low grade) -- *TREATED with RESECTION only*
    – Periosteal OS (intermediate grade) – High-grade surface OS
- Staging
  - Radiographic
    - plain films and MRI
      - osteolytic and osteoblastic (EWS tends to be only osteolytic)
      - Look for "skip lesions" on MRI
    - CT chest/CXR
    - Bone scan
  - Assessment
    - Local vs met
    - resectable vs not
- Treatmant
  - Surgery
    - remove of ALL tumor (including mets)
    - Timing after neoadjuvant chemo (week 10)
  - Chemo
    - Localized, resected--HD Mtx, Dox, Cisplay (MAP)
    - Met, unresected--MAP +/- I&E
- Parosteal much better prognosis
- %necrosis
  - >90 75-80% 5-yr survival
  - <90 40-50% 5-yr survival
** EWS
- Epidemiology
  - higher rate in whites
- Genetics
  - t(11;22) EWS-FLI-1 fusion
- Pathology
  - IHC for CD99+, Vimentin+
- Staging
  - Plain films & MRI
  - CT chest
  - Bone scan
  - Bilateral BM
  - Is it localized or metastatic is the main question
- Therapy
  - Local control should not compromize systemic therapy, since relapse is often due to development of mets
  - Surgery and RT probably equivalent
  - Surgery is after 12 weeks or so of Chemo
  - chemo
    - VDC + I/E (VCR, Dox, Cyclosphamide, Ifos, Etop)
    - interval compression
    - ?SCT

- Class I (A, B, C)
  - found ubiquitously on cells
- Class II (DR, DQ, DP)
  - found on APCs, B-cells
- Minor HLA antigen

#+CAPTION: Stem cell match levels
#+NAME: tab:hsctmatch
| alleles                   | Match level |

| A, B, C, DRB1, DQB1, DPB1 | 12/12       |
- Sources of stem cells
  - Cord blood (1 is enough for a kid, 2 for adults)
  - Bone Marrow
  - PBMC
- Key considerations for choosing a Donor
  - HLA match trumps everything
  - Single-allele mismatch is max for BM/PBSC (7/8)
  - Cord blook allows 4/6
    - trying to go higher if possible
  - BM is preferred in peds over PBSC
    - Data particularly strong for non-malignant disorders
    - PBSC is faster to engraft, but more GVHD  
  - Choose adult if possible (for ethical reasons)
  - CMV neg for neg recipient
  - Avoid multiparous females if possible
  - Donor size (max to take is 20mL/kg)
  - almost NEVER use identical twin
- Donor screening
  - Assent
  - Avoid risk to donor health
  - full assessment of donor for general health
  - Screen for HIV, HBV, HCV, syphilis, West Nile, Chagas, etc.
- T-cell content
  - Higher T-cell associated with faster engraftment, more GVHD, less relapse, lower infection risk
  - PBSC (high) > BM (moderate) > Cord (low) > T-depleated BM/PBSC
** Transplant
*** Prep regimens
- Myeloablative superior to reduced intensity for AML/MDS
  - busulfan, typically
- For non-malig disorders, reduced intensity when possible
- Some require reduced intensity
  - FA, due to 
  - SCID (IL2RG mutation for X-linked SCID), no prep needed at all for sibling
*** Post-day 1
- Infection
#+CAPTION: Post-transplant infection overview
#+NAME: fig:hsctinfx
[[./hsctinfx.png]]
  - prevention and prophylaxis
    - HSV/VZV acyclovir
    - CMV Gancyclovir or forscarnet if quant-PCR elevated
    - Fungal fluconazole or voriconazole
    - PJP septra "load" pre-HCT
    - Bacterial proph not standard
    - IVIG for hypogammaglobulinemia
  - Key infection considerations
    - T-cell depleted (cord blood or actually depleted) higher risk of viral infx
    - Occurrence of cGVHD adds to risk
*** Acute GVHD
- Usually diagnosed by day 100
- almost always involves skin, staging includes:
  - skin Rash % of coverage
  - Liver based on bili
  - Gut based on diarrhea
- Grading -- this is what matters for survival
  - 1: skin only
  - 2: liver or gut minimal involvement
  - 3: Stage II or III gut/liver
  - 4: Any stage IV organ system
- Prophylaxis
  - Calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus or cyclosporine) + MTX
  - MMF for cord
  - Skin only=Topical steroids
  - If multisystem disease ==> high dose steroids until under control (<7 days, typically)
*** Chronic GVHD
- after day 100, typically
- findings
  - skin: sclerotic changes
  - lung
  - dry eyes
- Standard Rx = prednisone 1mg/kg/day over many weeks to a couple of years, typically multiple agents
*** Complications after transplant
- PTLD
  - occurs within a few months of transplant, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly
  - Highly associated with T-cell depletion
  - Treatment is to withdrawal immunosuppression if possible
- VOD
  - typically within 2 weeks of transplant (day 1-30)
  - about 25% affected, but only 5% really severe
  - endothelial damage is etiology
  - associated with Cy, Bu, and TBI
  - S&S
    - weight gain
    - RUQ pain
    - fluid overload
  - Rx
    - fluid management
    - consider defibrotide, an antithrombotic
- Transplant-associated Thrombotic Microangiopathy
  - Looks like HUS
  - schistocytes, up LDH, Thrombocytopenia
- Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES)
  - Headache, confusion, seizures, and visual loss and most often caused by *malignant hypertension*.
  - In HSCT patients, the intractable hypertension and the associated PRES have been linked to the use of calcineurin- inhibitors (tacrolimus and cyclosporine).
  - The diagnosis of PRES is typically made on MRI imaging of the brain, which reveals a characteristic pattern of enhancement, commonly in the posterior circulation, which may be seen, but poorly on CT
  - Rx = control their malignant hypertension
- *MOST COMMON CAUSE OF DEATH after transplant is RELAPSE*

** Indications for transplant
- Cancer Treatment
  - Allows high dose chemotherapy
- Immunological platform
  - Replacementor“Resetting”ofaDysfunctional Hematopoietic/Immune System
  - Absent vs. aberrant function
- GeneTherapy
  - Only useful if the gene can be delivered by hematopoietic cells
*** ALL
- CR1
  - Primary induction failure
  - Hypodiploidy (<44 chromosomes) 
  - Persistent MRD after consolidation
- CR2
  - Early BM relapse (<36m from dx, esp if on rx)
  - Late BM relapse if MRD+ after reinduction
  - Any T-cell or Ph+ BM relapse
- CR3—any relapse
*** AML
- CR1
  - Induction failure
  - Mono-7, Mono-5, Del 5q, High AR flt-3/ITD+
  - Persistent MRD after induction (experimental)
  - Most recent approach
    - Sibling donor, pt with intermediate/HR disease
- CR2, CR3—any relapse 
- AutoBMT?
  - CBF or M3 AML with late relapse (>12m from dx) and clean marrow (PCR negative)
*** Myeloproliferative diseases
- CML
  - Resistance/failure of TKIs
  - Good donor with strong family preference 
    - Significant growth failure with TKIs
  - Advanced phase
- MDS
  - Any child with MDS
  - Adults “low risk” MDS: wait until progression
- JMML
  - Trying to define “better actors”, currently omit Noonan’s
  - Careful with NF1 pts, they may have CNS tumors, peripheral nerve sheath tumors
*** Lymphoma
- NHL
  - Relapsed Disease (attempt auto)
    - For lymphoblastic treat similar to ALL (allo)
    - Allo role for resistant or relapse after auto
- HL
  - Auto for relapsed/resistant disease
  - Allo can salvage auto failures if disease responsive
*** Solid tumors
- Neuroblastoma
  - Documented Improvement for High Risk CR1 patients
- Brain Tumors
  - Good data for use in <3yo to avoid XRT
  - Data in medulloblastoma, CNS germ cell tumors for relapsed disease
- Responsiveness, resectability, XRT important • OtherTumors
  - Role for Ewings, relapsed HR Wilm’s, Rhabdo unsure
  - Responsive HR germ cell tumors (relapsed) and HR retinoblastoma, some evidence of benefit with auto

- Erythrocytes
  - Type and crossmatch
#+CAPTION: Patient RBCs are added to known plasma to see if there is lysis. Then, as a followup, patient plasma is added to known cells to confirm.

  - Rh is the most immunogenic RBC minor antigen, 85% of pop is positive. If exposed, 80% will form an antibody (hence setup for pregnancy, etc.)
- Platelets
  - generally type only
  - No Rh on platelets, but there is a little RBC in the platelets, so may want to think about 
- Frozen plasma/Cryo
  - 
** Testing 
- DAT
  - Patient's RBCs mixed with anti-human IgG (Coombs)
  - IgG reagent binds to IgG or complement on RBC and results in RBC agglutination
  - DAT can be positive in:
    - Alloimmunizatin if donated RBCs are coated with alloantibodies
    - autoimmunization if the patients OWN RBC are coated with antibody
- Screening (IAT)
  - Screening is the process of adding patient plasma to a known set of cells
  - Goal is to identify unforeseen reactions, such as to unusual minor antigens (besides ABO, D)
- Type-and-screen vs type-and-crossmatch
  - T & S
    - Order should be placed when patient may need pRBC, but not needed immediately
  - T & C
    - Order when going to give blood, as part of unit is used for doing crossmatch
** Indications
- Whole Blood Transfusion Indications
  - Neonatal exchange
  - Often for autologous transfusion
  - Fresh whole blood for cardiac bypass
- Exchange for hemolytic disease of the newborn
  - ABO mismatch
  - Rh mismatch
- pRBC
  - 10-15 ml/kg raises Hgb by 1 unit
  - autologous (bank blood prior to big surgery, etc)
  - Directed donor (probably a bad idea for HSCT because of potential for rejection after HLA mismatch)
- platelets
  - platelet refractory state
    - non-immune
    - immune
    - testing 15-60 minutes post-transfusion is best time to test for platelet refractory
- FFP
  - TTP
  - when active bleeding and no specific concentrate available
  - very rapid reversal of warfarin
- Cryo
  - Congenital or acquired hypofibrinogenemia
  - Note that there is NO factor IX in cryo
** Selection of blood products
- Irradiation
  - prevend TA-GVHD by rendering T-cells in product incapable of proliferating
    - 
  - Blood from relatives should be irradiated
  - Needed for immunocompromised patients since they cannot eliminate donor lymphocytes
- Leukoreduction
  - try to reduce:
    - febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction (from neutrophils)
    - transfusion-transmitted CMV (from monocytes)
    - HLA-alloimmunization (from neutrophils)
- Washing
  - wash proteins and K+ from pRBC and platelets
** Transfusion reactions
- Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)
  - non-cardiogenic pulm edema starting 6-8 hours from transfusion
  - indistinguisable from ARDS
  - Only male plasma is given, as it is thought that antibodies from donor plasma reacting with patient lymphocytes is the cause
  - May be fatal
- TACO Transfusion-associated circulatory overload
  - just fluit overload and associated S&S
- Hemolytic
  - Acute: *IgM*, intravascular--can kill you
  - delayed: extravascular, *IgG*
- Massive transfusion problems
  - when giving large pRBC transfusion, be sure to give plasma as well to supply clotting factors, etc.
