** Neuroanatomy
Three main areas to know:
- Supratentatorial
- Infratentatorial
- Sellar

** Brain tumor classification
*** Tumors of Neuroepithelial Tissue (WHO)
- Astrocytic Tumors
  - Pilocytic Astrocytoma (most common)
- Oligodendroglial tumors
  -
- Oligoastrocytic tumors
- Ependymal Tumors
- Choroid plexus tumors
- Other
- Neuronal and mixed neuronal-glial tumors
- Tumor of the pineal region
- Embryonal tumors
*** Cell type of origin classification
**** Primary cell types
- Neuroglial cells
  - Astrocytes
  - Oligodendrocytes
  - Ependyma
  - Choroid plexus
- Neuronal/Embryonal Cells
- Other stuff (microglia)
*** Low grade vs High Grade "Gliomas"
Gliomas are a broad group of tumors. In pediatrics, "gliomas"=="astrocytomas"
- Gliomas == Astrocytomas in pediatrics
  - Pylocytic ("low grade", WHO 1)
  - Fibrillary or infiltrative
    - diffuse fibrillary ("low grade", WHO 2)
    - Anaplastic ("High Grade", WHO 3)
    - GBM ("High Grade", WHO 4)
WHO categorization is a CLINICAL PROGNOSTIC classification system.  (There is no WHO 2 Pilocytic, for example).  Higher WHO is associated with worse prognosis, largely.
*** Topographic classification
- Embryonal tumors
  - Pineal region: Pineoblastoma
  - Cerebellum: Medulloblastoma
  - Cerebrum: Supratentorial PNET
*** Diagnoses by location
- Infratentorial (about 2/3 of pediatric brain tumors)
  - Medulloblastoms
  - Pilocytic astrocytoma
  - Ependymoma
  - DIPG
  - AT/RT
- Sellar
  - Craniopharyngioma
  - Adenoma
  - Hamartoma
  - Pilocytic Astrocytoma
  - Germ cell tumors
  - PNET
  - Langerhans (stalk)
- Thalamus
  - AA/GBM
  - Pilocytic Astro
  - Teratoma
  - PNET
- Pineal
  - Pineoblastoma
  - Germ cell tumors
  - Pineal cyst
  - PNET
  - Astrocytomas
- Hemispheres
  - Gliomas, both low and high grade
  - PNET
  - AT/RT
  - Ependymoma
  - Choroid plexus tumors (choroid plexus produces CSF, in all ventricles)
- Optic Pathway
  - Pilocytic
  - RB

** Treatment overview
#+CAPTION: Overview of brain tumor Rx
#+NAME:   fig:braintumorRx
[[braintumorRx.png]]
- Neurosurgery
  - Generally, needed, at least for biopsy
  - DIPG is a radiographic diagnosis
  - Most NG-GCT Dx is made based on CSF tumor markers
- Radiation
  - Potentially utilized for ALL CNS tumors
  - exceptions include low grade gliomas (initially) and choroid plexus papillomas
  - full dose = ~5400-5940 cGy
  - Craniospinal irradiation = ~1800-3600 cGy
- Chemo
  - Used as adjuvant therapy in most cases
  - Particularly useful for Germ cell tumors and Embryonal tumors
  - Used with little kids IN PLACE OF XRT, though this is inferior when used

** The tumors
*** Medullo
    - Synonyms: Cerebellar PNET
    - Histo: SRBCT; different forms have different outcomes, so histology is useful.
    - Clinical presentation
      - Raised ICP (headache, vomiting)
      - Ataxia
      - Brainstem findings (sometimes)
    - Metastatic potential: Yes
      - Neuraxis (so must do spinal MRI, maybe CSF)
      - Systemic spread very rare
    - Risk classification
|Features | Standard | High |
|---+---+---|
|Resection | <1.5 cm3 residual | >1.5 cm3 residual |
| M-staging | No mets | M+ |
| Histology |   | Anaplasia |
    - Genetics
      - Wnt group (children/adults) - Excellent prognosis
      - Sonic Hedgehog group (can include infants) - Fair 
      - Group 3 (i17q, MYC amp)
      - Group 4 (CDK4 amp, MYCN amp)
    - Imaging
      - brightly enhancing Midline mass, but lateralizes as you get older
      - A lateral mass in a younger kid is likely an ependymoma
    - Rx
      - Standard risk (>70% EFS)
        - Cut it out
        - 2340 cGy
        - Cisplatin/CCNC/VCR or Cisplatin/CTX/VCR
      - High risk (20%-70% EFS, depending on risk factors)
        - Cut it out
        - Craniospinal radiation (3600 cGy)
  - Ependymoma (common location)
    - Clinical presentation
      - Can occur throughout CNS
      - Symptoms depend on location, often on floor of fourth ventrical
      - Raised ICP, especially for 4th ventrical tumors
    - Metastatic potential: Yes
      - Neuraxis
    - Staging: MRI brain/spine, CSF cytopathology, not clear whether anaplasia affects prognosis
    - Imaging:
#+CAPTION: Ependymoma imaging
#+NAME:   fig:ependymoma
[[ependymoma.png]]
    - Rx
      - Aggressive upfront resection (GTR "required")
      - Non-met tumors (70% EFS):
        - Focal XRT
        - Role of chemo uncertain
      - Met tumors (bad EFS):
        - Focal XRT and CSI (craniospinal)
        - Maybe chemo
  - Cerebellar astrocytome (usually pilocytic)
  - Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor (increasingly recognized)
*** Brain stem tumors
  - Almost any brain tumor histology CAN occur in the brain stem
  - Need to be able to distinguish between DIPG and low grade astrocytoma
  - DIPG
    - Technically is an anaplastic astrocytoma of fibrillary type in the brain stem
    - Synonyms: "Brain stem glioma" (though most gliomas of the brain stem are not DIPG
    - Met Potential: No
    - Staging:
      - MRI of the brain only (if classic on imaging)--tend NOT to enhance
      - biopsy for atypical imaging features
    - Lab features will reveal diffuse astrocytoma of WHO 2, 3, or 4 (though prognosis is the same--all die).
    - Imaging
      - diffuse pontine tumor encasing (but not obstructing) the basilar artery)
    - Rx
      - No curative therapy
      - XRT is routinely used for disease stabilization
      - No role for chemo
    - Pointers:
      - There is a difference between "intrinsic pontine glioms" and Exophytic brain stem glioma
      - Exophytic BSGs are usually pilocytic astrocytomas with much better prognosis
      - PAs in the brain stem brightly enhance on post-gad MRI and are often in other of brain stem areas besides pons
      - DIPG tends not to enhance, while PAs tend to enhance post-gad
*** Pilocytic astrocytomas
  - Can occur anywhere in CNS, but common locations are:
    - Cerebellum (cerebellar astrocytoma)
    - Optic pathway (optic pathway glioma)
    - hypothalamus
    - brain stem
    - spinal cord
  - very slow growing
  - synonyms: astrocytoma (WHO 1), "low grade" glioma (not precise, though)
  - clinical presentation: location dependent
  - Met: Not really
  - staging: MRI, brain, spine
  - Laboratory features: BRAF mutations (V600E) and relevance for therapy, if present
  - Imaging:
#+CAPTION: Pilocytic astrocytoma with enhancing nodule and cystic mass
#+NAME:   fig:pilo
[[pilo.png]]
  - Rx:
    - Dependent on location
    - GTR is curative (cerebellar) and no further Rx needed
    - If GTR is not possible (optic pathway, hypothalamic [midline] tumors):
      - observation in few cases
      - Best effort resection then chemo/rad
  - Pointers:
    - Can occur anywhere
    - GTR is usually curative
    - Optic pathway tumors associate with NF-1 and often should be left alone
*** AA and GBM 
  - synonyms: Astrocytoma (WHO 3 and 4), high-grade gliomas
  - Clinical: variable, headaches, seizures due to ST predilection
  - Met: No (mainly no)
  - Staging: MRI brain/spine
  - Lab features: MGMT promoter methylation increasingly assayed (may be useful to know about for TMZ use)
  - Rx:
    - Best effort resection
    - Focal XRT, but hard to define because these tend to be very diffuse
    - Alkylators: TMZ or BCNU or CCNU
  - ~15-30% EFS
  - Pointers
    - No chemo except alkylating agents (nitrosureas and TMZ) are helpful
    - Anaplastic Astrocytoma is a spectrum disease, so some lower grade (WHO2) may do OK. Need to ask pathologist for "how much" AA is the patient.
*** Germinoma
  - synonyms: non-secreting GCT
  - clinical:
    - suprasellar: DI, panhypopituitarism
    - pineal: parinauds (can't look up, raised ICP)
  - met: Yes
  - staging
    - biopsy needed for diagnosis
    - MRI brain, spine, CSF pathology
  - lab: CSF markers (AFP/beta-HCG) should be negative.
